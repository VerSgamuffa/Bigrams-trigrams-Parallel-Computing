# Bigrams-trigrams-Parallel-Computing
Veronica Sgamuffa's project on creating histograms for bigrams and trigrams of characters and words(sequential and parallel versions with openMP).

This project includes the input.txt file with only one version of the novel “War and Peace” (GitHub does not support files larger than 100MB, and even the test version with x100 input is over 300MB).
